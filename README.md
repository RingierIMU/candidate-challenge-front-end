# Front End Candidate Challenge Project
### INTRODUCTION

Ringier, Ringier International Tech & Data Unit (RITDU) and Ringier One Africa Media (ROAM) serve up hundreds of millions of monthly request across dozens of marketplace platforms worldwide every month. 

These marketplace plaforms are made up of Cars, Jobs, Property and General Classified assets, uniquely localised and expertly scaled. 

This Challenge project will give you a gilmpse into life as a developer at ROAM / RITDU. 

### WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

We're aiming to understand where you're at as a modern Front End Developer. We do not expect a  production ready app, just enough for you to feel like you've communicated your level of skill to us. Ideally, all of the main features should be working, but the amount of spit-and-polish that you apply is completely up to you. 

We expect that this should take between 3-8 hours to complete, with at least another hour per bonus feature that you tackle. The idea that this is a big sacrifice of time is not lost on us! It's no small ask, but we find it important for the following reasons:

1. To give you time to decide if this is a product space that you could get excited about. 

2. For us to be able to honestly evaluate your competence, style and approach for the job at hand. 

3. For you to be forced to play with some of our unique stack. Especially *Tailwind CSS* which really needs to be experienced rather than explained. 

### THE CHALLENGE

Get into the head-space of buying or selling on your favourite marketplace plaform (e.g. Gumtree if you're in SA), and build us a basic marketplace POC. These are the main features we're after: 

1. A Listing Search Page (which could also be the Home / Landing Page). 
2. A Listing detail Page. (Showing More info on a single Listing)
3. A Create Listing Page

Details of fields to carry on each of these can be found at the bottom of this file. 

That makes up the base level of the applicaiton. In Addition, we ask that you choose at least one bonus feature below to implement.  (You an definitely pick more than one if you're on a roll!)

BONUS FEATURES:
* Add Auth onto the Listing Create Page. 
* Extend the search to add Filtering for Price
* Sign Up / Sign In Pages for User Creation
* Add Images onto Listing, including Image upload.
* Turn the Listing Create into a 2 Step Wizard. 
* Implement PurgeCSS 
* Docker / docker-compose Setup
* Automated Tests

### WHAT IS ALLOWED IN YOUR TOOLBELT?
* A Modern FE Framework. (VueJS, ReactJS or Angular)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (We'd really like you to give it a try)
* [Json Server ](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). If you'd prefer to roll your own real BE with something else, go ahead! But faking it with Json Server won't count against you in any way at all!
* Github (or bitbucket if you must!)

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Commit often, with meaningful commits. We'd rather see real commit history than it all magically coming together. Please start with one initial commit after starting with any framework / bootstrap code so that we can clearly distinguish where the community code ends and your code begins. 

2. Complete at least the basic features plus 1 bonus feature. 

3. This is a FE specific challenge. We expect to see the best practices from a modern FE developer. These include things like:
    * Adherance to community guidelines, standards and best practices
    * Component Driven Development
    * Routing
    * State Management
    * Clean Validation of all inputs
    * Functional Components
    * A clear, concise readme file with full setup instructions. 
    * ES6
    * Slots
    * Maintaining State on refresh

4. *Use Tailwind for CSS.* We know you probably have never touched it before, but now's a great time to get your feet wet and be exposed to something new!  We will not be too opinionated on implementing a specific design. You're welcome to just replicate a marketplace platform that already exists or just free-style it yourself. We won't expect it to be pixel perfect in every way, but it should be clean, simple and work on mobile (Mobile First) Remember, this is a development challenge, not a design challenge! 

5. Once you're done, please drop us a link to your repo on github. 

6. We wask that you get this submitted within 1 week of receiving the challenge. If you need further time, just drop us a message and let us know. 


That's it. If you're stuck with any of the above, or would like further resources on Tailwind css please do reach out. We're on ZaTech Slack or Email.
